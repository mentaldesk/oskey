  OS Key Behavior

  Dispatches to one of three bindings depending on the currently selected
  operating system (set via the os-selector behavior).

  The bindings property takes exactly three entries in order:
    1. Windows binding
    2. macOS binding
    3. Linux binding

  Example — a key that sends Ctrl on Windows/Linux but Cmd (GUI) on macOS:

    oskey_ctrl_cmd: os_key_ctrl_cmd {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-os-key";
        #binding-cells = <0>;
        bindings = <&kp LCTRL>, <&kp LGUI>, <&kp LCTRL>;
    };

  Then in the keymap layer:

    &oskey_ctrl_cmd

compatible: "zmk,behavior-os-key"

include: zero_param.yaml

properties:
  bindings:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
