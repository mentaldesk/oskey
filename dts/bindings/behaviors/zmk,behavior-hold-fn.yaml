  Hold-Fn Behavior

  Holds the Fn/Globe key (C_AC_NEXT_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT_SELECT) while pressing
  and releasing a single child binding.  Intended for macOS window-management
  shortcuts that require Fn held alongside another key combination.

  Example — Tile Left (Globe+Ctrl+Left on macOS):

    mac_tile_left: mac_fn_tile_left {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-fn";
        #binding-cells = <0>;
        bindings = <&kp GLOBE>, <&kp LC(LEFT)>;
    };

  Use this as the macOS binding inside a zmk,behavior-os-key:

    ok_win_tile_left: os_key_win_tile_left {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-os-key";
        #binding-cells = <0>;
        /*                   Win                   Mac                    Lin  */
        bindings = <&kp LG(LEFT)>, <&mac_tile_left>, <&none>;
    };

compatible: "zmk,behavior-hold-fn"

      Two behavior bindings:
        1. hold-binding — held down for the duration (e.g. &kp GLOBE)
        2. tap-binding  — pressed then released while hold-binding is active (e.g. &kp LC(LEFT))
