  OS Selector Behavior

  Selects the current operating system so that os-key behaviors dispatch
  to the correct per-OS binding.

  Example usage in a keymap behaviors block:

    os_sel: os_selector {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-os-selector";
        #binding-cells = <1>;
    };

  Then bind it with the OS constant as the parameter:

    &os_sel OS_WIN
    &os_sel OS_MAC
    &os_sel OS_LIN

  (requires #include <dt-bindings/zmk/oskey.h> in the keymap file)

compatible: "zmk,behavior-os-selector"

include: one_param.yaml
